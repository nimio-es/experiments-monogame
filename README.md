# experiments-monogame
An experiment with MonoGame on Mac done in early 2011

Added to my GitHub for future archaeologists

The actual code/project probably doesn't compile. Was made in a weekend to test the [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) library and I did not attend a lot of things like order, modularity, readability of code, etc., etc.

You can watch the project running in the next video:
